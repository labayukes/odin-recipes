This was my first HTML project and demonstration of fundamental knowledge on HTML.

Through this project I have demonstrated skills such as using: images, safer hyperlinkes, headings, bold fonts, paragraphs and ordered lists.
I have formed this through creating a single page site which directs you to certain recipes you may need within the italian cuisine.
